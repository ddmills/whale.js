# whale.js
Whale is a tiny library which provides strong MVC tools and components.

* Classical inheritance
* Dependency injection
* Factory and Service patterns (built off dependency injection)
* Events (dispatchers and listeners)
* Model, View, Controller classes (soon)

## Examples
Check out the examples to see how the different patterns are implemented

* "hello my name is Bob"
* "Arrr matey, my name is Pegleg. My weapon is a cannon"

### output for harbor example (service and factory)

* "A blue boat arrives the harbor"
* "A yellow boat arrives the harbor"
